Game Features
The game can be played between two players.
The game board is a 3x3 grid.
Each player takes turns marking a square on the game board with their symbol (X or O).
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
If all squares on the game board are filled and no player has three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, then the game is a tie.
The player can restart the game after the game ends.
How to Play
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
The first player clicks on an empty square to mark it with their symbol (X or O).

Players continue to take turns until one player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or until all squares on the game board are filled.
